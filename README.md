Hi there! I'm Max Bazuev, a seasoned hybrid mobile app consultant and developer on a mission to make life easier and more predictable for people around the world. I love sharing my professional experience through educational videos, and when I'm not busy building awesome apps, you'll likely find me exploring the great outdoors. ðŸŒ²

## Technologies I use and why:

| Technology | Badge | Reason |
| ---------- | ----- | ------ |
| Quasar | [![Quasar Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Quasar-%233D9970.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=Quasar&logoColor=white)](https://quasar.dev/) | Beautiful, high-performance UIs with minimal effort? Sign me up! Quasar allows me to focus on the important stuff while it takes care of crafting responsive and visually appealing apps. |
| Vue 3 | [![Vue Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vue-%234FC08D.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=Vue.js&logoColor=white)](https://vuejs.org/) | An intuitive, flexible, and performant framework for building modern web applications. Vue 3 brings reactivity and simplicity together, so I can create powerful apps without breaking a sweat. |
| Capacitor v4 | [![Capacitor Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Capacitor-%235929CB.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=Capacitor&logoColor=white)](https://capacitorjs.com/) | One codebase to rule them all! Capacitor allows me to write web app code that runs seamlessly on Android, iOS, and the web, making my hybrid mobile apps truly cross-platform. |
| TypeScript | [![TypeScript Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-%233178C6.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=TypeScript&logoColor=white)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) | With TypeScript, I can write more robust, maintainable, and less error-prone code. Static types for the win! |
| TRPC | [![TRPC Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/TRPC-%23F3F4F6.svg?&style=for-the-badge)](https://trpc.io/) | Client-server communication has never been easier. TRPC offers type-safe Remote Procedure Calls that save me from countless headaches and keyboard smashes. |
| Docker | [![Docker Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-%232496ED.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=Docker&logoColor=white)](https://www.docker.com/) | Consistency is key, and Docker helps me ensure my applications run smoothly across different environments using containerization. |
| Kubernetes (k0s) | [![Kubernetes Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kubernetes-%23326CE5.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=Kubernetes&logoColor=white)](https://kubernetes.io/) | Orchestrating containerized applications has never been simpler. With Kubernetes and k0s, I can deploy, scale, and manage my apps like a pro. |
